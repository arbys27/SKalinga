# SKalinga San Antonio — Full System Module Test Cases

## Document purpose

This is the execution-oriented QA test plan for the current SKalinga codebase. It is organized by module and follows the actual pages, JavaScript, PHP APIs, sessions, uploads, and database entities found in the repository.

The tester should record:

- **Status:** Not Run / Pass / Fail / Blocked
- **Evidence:** screenshot, browser console, network response, API response, database query result, or log reference
- **Defect ID:** linked issue when a case fails

Unless a case says otherwise, test both:

- Desktop Chromium at 1440px.
- Mobile viewport at 375px wide.

Never use production personal data. Use synthetic accounts, files, names, phone numbers, and CSV records.

## Secure service verification

Apply PostgreSQL migration `008_service_verification.sql`. These cases use a youth
account and a print request in `Completed` status; the current implementation does
not issue tokens for borrow, event, or health requests because those services do
not yet have individual pending-request records.

| ID | Test flow | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| VERIFY-001 | As a youth, generate a QR from an owned completed print request. | QR contains only a random token; server stores only its SHA-256 hash; expiry is about three minutes. |
| VERIFY-002 | As staff, scan/enter the token and confirm the claim. | Minimal youth/service details appear; the token becomes `used`, print request becomes `Claimed`, and audit/activity logs identify staff, service, and IP. |
| VERIFY-003 | Scan after expiry. | Request is rejected; token becomes `expired`; failure is audited. |
| VERIFY-004 | Scan/confirm a token that was already used. | Request is rejected; the service cannot be completed a second time. |
| VERIFY-005 | Generate with another youth's request ID or a non-existent/pending request. | No token is issued; ownership and claimable status are enforced server-side. |
| VERIFY-006 | Set `otp_required = true`, scan, send OTP, and confirm with a correct code. | OTP is sent to the registered phone; only the correct unexpired code completes the claim; code is single-use. |
| VERIFY-007 | Enter an incorrect/expired OTP five times. | Confirmation fails and OTP verification locks; attempts are audited. |
| VERIFY-008 | Cancel an active token from the youth session, then scan it. | Token becomes `cancelled`; later staff validation fails. |
| VERIFY-009 | Generate six tokens for one user in an hour. | The sixth generation is rate-limited; no active token is created by the rejected request. |
| VERIFY-010 | Call admin endpoints with a youth session or without CSRF. | Youth receives HTTP 403; missing/invalid CSRF is rejected. |
| VERIFY-011 | Attempt to scan a permanent member ID or QR payload containing a member ID. | Validation fails; only the random 64-character verification token is accepted. |
| VERIFY-012 | Try to confirm or reject a token from a different staff account, or without validating it first. | Action is rejected; the validating staff identity must match. |

## 1. Test environment and baseline

### 1.1 Environment assumptions

| Item | Expected/current implementation |
|---|---|
| Web server | Apache/XAMPP serving `http://localhost/SKalinga/` |
| PHP | PHP 8.x; syntax baseline previously verified on PHP 8.2.12 |
| Database | MySQL/MariaDB database `skalinga_youth` |
| Browser | Chromium-based browser with DevTools |
| Accounts | One youth, one `staff`/SK official, one `superadmin` |
| Test files | Valid/invalid JPG, PNG, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, oversized files, renamed MIME-spoofed files |
| Test data | At least two youth users, three resources, three events, incidents in each status, and printing requests in each status |

### 1.2 Baseline smoke cases

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| ENV-001 | Start Apache and MySQL; open `index.html`. | Redirect reaches `login.html`; no PHP/JS fatal error. |
| ENV-002 | Open `login.html`, inspect DevTools Console and Network. | Page renders without blocking errors; external dependency failures are visible and non-fatal. |
| ENV-003 | Request `api/me.php` without a session. | HTTP 401 JSON response; no HTML warning or stack trace. |
| ENV-004 | Request `api/check_admin_session.php` without a session. | HTTP 401/JSON response; no protected data. |
| ENV-005 | Open every HTML page directly without a session. | Public pages remain usable; protected pages redirect to login. |
| ENV-006 | Use browser refresh during each authenticated module. | Session remains valid; data reloads without duplicate submissions. |
| ENV-007 | Stop the database and load a data page. | Visible user-facing error/retry state; no raw SQL credentials or exception text. |
| ENV-008 | Restore the database and retry. | Module recovers without a full browser restart. |
| ENV-009 | Run `php -l` over all PHP files. | Zero syntax errors. |
| ENV-010 | Load the application at 375px, 768px, and desktop widths. | No critical clipping, horizontal page scroll, inaccessible modal, or hidden submit control. |

# 2. Authentication, session, registration, and recovery

## 2.1 Login page — `login.html` / `api/login.php`

### Controls and UI checks

| ID | Test flow | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| AUTH-001 | Open login page. Inspect logo, title, identifier input, password input, submit button, password visibility control, forgot-password control, registration link, and error region. | All controls are visible, labeled, keyboard reachable, and visually aligned. |
| AUTH-002 | Submit with both fields empty. | Native/server validation identifies both required fields; no request with empty credentials. |
| AUTH-003 | Submit identifier only. | Password-required validation appears. |
| AUTH-004 | Submit password only. | Identifier-required validation appears. |
| AUTH-005 | Toggle password visibility twice. | Type changes password/text and returns correctly; password value is not lost. |
| AUTH-006 | Press Tab through the complete form and press Enter on submit. | Logical focus order; Enter submits once. |
| AUTH-007 | Submit valid youth email/password. | HTTP success, role `youth`, redirect to `youth-portal.html`, authenticated session created. |
| AUTH-008 | Submit valid youth voter ID/password. | Same successful youth result. |
| AUTH-009 | Submit valid youth phone/password. | Same successful youth result. |
| AUTH-010 | Submit valid admin username/password. | Role maps correctly to `admin` or `sk_official`; redirect to admin dashboard. |
| AUTH-011 | Submit valid admin email/password. | Same successful admin result. |
| AUTH-012 | Submit wrong password. | HTTP 401; generic invalid-credentials message; no account-existence disclosure. |
| AUTH-013 | Submit unknown identifier. | Same generic invalid-credentials response. |
| AUTH-014 | Submit inactive/suspended user credentials. | Login rejected; no protected session. |
| AUTH-015 | Submit an identifier that matches both admin and youth. | HTTP 409 collision response; no account selected implicitly. |
| AUTH-016 | Submit ten or more invalid attempts from one IP within the rate window. | Rate-limit response; no database overload; clear retry guidance. |
| AUTH-017 | Add `redirect=javascript:...`, external URL, path traversal, and unknown filename. | Redirect is restricted to the server allowlist; no open redirect/XSS. |
| AUTH-018 | Submit duplicate clicks rapidly. | One effective login request/session; no duplicate activity-log corruption. |
| AUTH-019 | Inspect response bodies and browser storage. | No password, password hash, OTP, or sensitive database detail returned. |
| AUTH-020 | Login, copy session cookie, log out, then replay the cookie. | Replay is rejected; session is destroyed. |
| AUTH-021 | Login, inspect session identifier before/after. | Session identifier changes after authentication. |
| AUTH-022 | Login with Unicode/whitespace variants of identifiers. | Normalization behavior is consistent and documented; no unintended account collision. |

## 2.2 Logout and session lifecycle — `api/logout.php`, `api/me.php`

| ID | Test flow | Expected |

| AUTH-028 | Call protected API after logout. | HTTP 401 or redirect; no data mutation. |
| AUTH-029 | Open a protected page from browser history after logout. | Client guard redirects; page does not expose protected data. |
| AUTH-030 | Let session expire or invalidate it server-side while page is open; trigger an API call. | 401 handled visibly; stale protected UI is not presented as current. |

## 2.3 Youth activation — `youth-register.html`, `masterlist_verify.php`, `masterlist_activate.php`

| ID | Test flow | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| AUTH-031 | Open registration as unauthenticated user. | Two-step activation UI renders with progress state. |

The document contains **387 unique IDs**: **375 executable test cases** plus **12 confirmed-defect retest references** in the defect seed list. The 12 defect rows are references to existing tests, not additional executable cases. The category totals above now match the IDs in the test tables.

## Current execution record — 2026-10-09

Environment: local XAMPP, Apache, PHP 8.2.12, MariaDB, Chromium. This is a partial run, not a full release sign-off. Testing began read-only; the user later authorized CRUD using synthetic data and cleanup. Only the listed cases have a Pass or Fail status; all other executable cases remain **Not Run**. Youth-only mutations, password reset, file variants other than the noted PNG subcase, database-outage, rollback/fault-injection, and other unlisted cases were not run.

Successful and failed login probes were run against the documented local seed accounts. Normal authentication records (`login_attempts`, `last_login`, and `activity_logs`) may therefore have changed. After the user authorized synthetic CRUD, test-only resource rows, youth accounts, and a health announcement were created and cleaned up. A synthetic disclosure PNG was uploaded and removed through its delete API; a synthetic youth registry record was deleted through its API. The health delete endpoint archived rather than deleted its synthetic row, so that exact row was removed directly from the local test database after verifying its unique QA title and ID. All synthetic resource, borrow, health, youth, disclosure, and file fixtures were verified absent after cleanup. Health audit rows and authentication logs were retained. No actual youth records were intentionally edited or deleted.

# Freedom Wall — moderation and privacy test cases

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| FW-001 | Apply migration `007_freedom_wall.sql` twice. | Freedom Wall table, constraints, indexes, trigger, and RLS are created; rerun succeeds. |
| FW-002 | Open `freedom-wall.html` without a session or as an admin. | Page redirects to login; APIs reject non-youth submission and my-post requests. |
| FW-003 | Submit valid youth feedback with anonymous enabled. | Post is stored as pending with the real user ID; no submission details are added to the public board. |
| FW-004 | Submit an invalid category, blank title/body, title over 120 characters, or body over 2,000 characters. | API rejects the request with HTTP 422 and no post is created. |
| FW-005 | Submit a sixth post within an hour for one youth. | API returns HTTP 429; earlier posts remain unchanged. |
| FW-006 | Load public posts with pending, rejected, approved, and hidden records present. | Only approved, non-hidden posts are returned; anonymous display name is “Anonymous Youth”; other names are limited to first name and last initial. |
| FW-007 | Load `my_posts.php` as a youth with pending and rejected posts. | Only the signed-in youth’s records are returned; rejection reason is visible only to that submitter. |
| FW-008 | Approve a pending post as an admin and as an SK official. | Status becomes approved with approved_by, approved_at, moderated_by, and moderated_at set; action is audited. |
| FW-009 | Reject a pending post with and without a reason. | Status becomes rejected; optional reason and moderation metadata are stored and only returned to the submitter/admin. |
| FW-010 | Hide an approved post as a moderator. | Post remains in private moderation records but is removed from public results; action is audited. |
| FW-011 | Call each admin endpoint with a youth session and each youth private endpoint with an admin session. | Unauthorized role receives HTTP 403 with no private records returned. |
| FW-012 | Enter HTML/script text in post content and render board/admin views. | Content appears as text and never executes as markup or script. |
| HLTH-009 | Pass | Empty required fields and invalid category were rejected with HTTP 422; no record created by those requests. |
| HLTH-010 | Pass | Past date, negative slots, and end time before start were each rejected with HTTP 422. |
| HLTH-013 | Pass | Synthetic Draft was present in admin listing and absent from public listing. |
| HLTH-014 | Pass | Updated synthetic announcement to Published; public list then included it. |
| HLTH-016 | Pass | Synthetic announcement fields updated and were returned with the edited values. |
| HLTH-017 | Fail | `health_announcements/delete.php` returned “archived”; repeating the delete also returned success and left the row Archived. The test-only row was subsequently removed by an exact-ID/title cleanup query. |
| RES-003 | Pass | Synthetic resource creation returned a generated item ID with quantity and available both matching the submitted integer quantity. |
| RES-004 | Fail | Decimal quantity `1.5` was accepted and truncated to `1` by both resource creation and borrow APIs, instead of being rejected. Test resources were cleaned up. |
| RES-005 | Fail | Two resources with the same synthetic name were both created successfully with different generated item IDs; duplicate names are not rejected. Both rows were cleaned up. |
| RES-010 | Fail | Borrow API accepted a clearly nonexistent synthetic member ID and created a borrow record. The test record was deleted and inventory restored. |
| RES-013 | Fail | Zero, negative, and above-available borrow quantities were rejected; however decimal `1.5` was accepted as quantity `1`. |
| RES-014 | Pass | Synthetic borrow reduced available inventory by the borrowed amount; exact-available borrow reached zero; return restored inventory; cleanup left inventory at its original value. |
| RES-016 | Pass | Two concurrent synthetic requests against one available unit produced one successful borrow and one rejection; available quantity did not go below zero. |
| RES-019 | Pass | Repeated return of a synthetic already-returned borrow was rejected with HTTP 400; inventory stayed at its original count. |
| RES-020 | Pass | Deleting an active synthetic borrow restored its quantity; deleting a returned record did not increment inventory again. |
| REG-006 | Fail | Invalid email and empty required fields were rejected, and duplicate email returned 409. Two synthetic accounts with the same invalid phone value were both accepted, so phone uniqueness/validation is not enforced. Both accounts were deleted. |
| REG-007 | Pass | A synthetic youth account/profile was created with a generated member ID and deleted after verification. Source uses `password_hash()`; the API response did not include a password/hash. |
| ENV-010 | Fail | At 320/375px, horizontal document overflow was measured on youth events, borrowing, printing, and report pages; profile also overflowed at 320px. |
| PORTAL-001 | Fail | Portal displayed the youth identity, but Chromium reported `ReferenceError: fetchHealthAnnouncements is not defined`. |
| PORTAL-008 | Fail | Service cards are non-focusable `div` elements (`tabIndex=-1`) without link/button semantics. |
| EVT-Y-001 | Fail | Youth `get_user_profile.php` returned HTTP 403; events page then raised a `TypeError` while updating a missing profile element. |
| RES-001 | Fail | Admin resources/borrowing data requests failed JSON parsing because PHP emitted a duplicate `session_start()` notice. |
| SET-001 | Fail | Admin Settings page displayed “Under Maintenance” instead of settings controls. |
| SET-002 | Fail | No settings controls were available to inspect; page displayed “Under Maintenance”. |
| API-001 | Fail | POST to GET data route `api/get_events.php` returned HTTP 200/data instead of 405; tested POST-only routes returned 405 to GET. |
| API-002 | Pass | Tested protected APIs without a session returned 401 JSON. |
| API-003 | Pass | Youth-session requests to checked admin APIs returned 403 JSON. |
| API-008 | Fail | `api/get_resources.php` and `api/get_borrow_records.php` returned HTTP 200 with HTML notice text, not parseable JSON. |
| API-011 | Fail | The API warning response exposed the local server filesystem path and PHP source filename. |
| API-013 | Fail | Observed session cookie had no `HttpOnly` or `SameSite` attribute. HTTPS-only `Secure` behavior was not assessed on localhost. |
| UX-002 | Fail | Mobile youth pages showed horizontal overflow at 320/375px, including events and borrowing. |
| A11Y-009 | Fail | Youth service cards are clickable-looking `div`s without keyboard focusability or link/button semantics. |

Additional unscored subcase evidence: a synthetic PNG disclosure upload appeared in the admin list; the youth-only public-list API correctly returned 403 to the admin session; deleting the disclosure removed both the row and stored file (subsequent file request returned 404). Other supported file types and the delete-confirmation cancel path were not exercised, so the full DISC-A-003/DISC-A-008 cases remain Not Run.

The youth login route returned HTTP 429 during CRUD testing because the local IP had reached its authentication-attempt limit. Youth-only incident and printing mutations were not attempted or bypassed; those cases remain Not Run. The 429 was not treated as a valid AUTH-016 result because the attempts included successful logins and were not a controlled series of ten invalid attempts.

The remaining **323 executable cases are Not Run**. The **12 DEF retest references** were not separately rerun. Two Critical defects are listed in the defect seed list and remain unverified. Do not mark the suite Pass: this partial run found failures, and most workflows still need execution in a dedicated test database with synthetic fixtures.

## Release decision

- **Pass:** No open Critical/High defects; all required module and E2E cases pass.
- **Conditional:** Only Medium/Low defects remain with documented workarounds and presentation approval.
- **Fail:** Any Critical/High security, authorization, data-integrity, authentication, upload, or core workflow defect remains open.
